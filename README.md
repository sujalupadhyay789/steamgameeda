# Data science project:<br>Steam Games Exploratory data analysis

This project started as a final assignment for Data science course at Milwaukee School of Engineering. You can read the full project assignment in 'eda/Project description.pdf'. At the end of the course, I continued working on this data analysis.

The project objective was to apply all knowledge and methods learned in the course in a end-to-end data science project.

Project has been built using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** for easy readability.
